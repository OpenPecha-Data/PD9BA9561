Food Offering Prayer
by Longchen Rabjam

ho, dak lü pung kham kyemché ni
Ho! The aggregates, elements and sense organs of my body
den sum tsangwé ngowo té
Are in essence the three seats of completeness.1
dampa rik gyé kyilkhor lha
In this maṇḍala of the hundred peaceful and wrathful deities
gulkyö tamché dewa ché
All movement is great bliss.
dorjé damtsik lanamé
The unsurpassable vajra samaya,
changchub sem kyi trin chenpor
The great cloud of bodhicitta,
nyimé nyampé ngang du rol
All this I enjoy in the state of indivisible equality.
naljor lam gyi tsok dzok né
May we perfect the accumulations of the yogic path
zé kyi dribpar mingyur shying
Without any obscuration arising due to food
tenpa mepé jindak kyang
And may the generous patron, too,
tekchen drebur chöpar shok
Enjoy the fruits of the Mahāyāna.

These are the words of the omniscient Dharma king, Drimé Özer.
