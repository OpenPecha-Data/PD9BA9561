Prayer to Longchenpa (Adapted from the Words of Mipham Rinpoche)
by Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche

döné lhündrub ösal rigpé shi
The primordial and spontaneous nature of luminous awareness
gyurmé gyalwa kün dang ronyam pa
Is unchanging and of one-taste with all the victorious buddhas.
ngönsum zikpa künkhyen chö kyi jé
To you who have perceived this directly, Omniscient Lord of Dharma,
drimé özer shyab la solwa deb
Drimé Özer, I pray!

tek chok lung dön tsang la manorwa
With your brilliant, stainless insight you have clearly and unerringly understood
drimé rikpé tsul zang saljé ching
The meaning of the supreme vehicle in its entirety
zabmo né kyi mengak dang denpa
And are possessed of the pith instructions of profound key points:
sung rab lek shé tsok la solwa deb
To the collection of your speech—fine explanations all—I pray!

sé ché gyalwé sung yang sengé dré
The lion's roar that is the beautiful speech of buddhas and bodhisattvas
lungten jishyin namshyik gönpo khyö
Has prophesied that you, protector, will awaken
namdren rirab marmé gyaltsen du
And be renowned as the guide Rirab Marmé Gyaltsen.
ngönpar changchub nyepa dé yi tsé
At that time may I and all parent beings gather
dak dang dak gi magyur drowa kün
At the place of your enlightenment as youthful bodhisattvas,
shying der gyalsé shyönnü namrol gyi
And, having enjoyed the nectar of your true words,
den sung chö kyi dütsir longchö né
Receive a prophecy of our very own —
tob chu ngawar lungten nyé gyur chik
That we too will attain the ten powers!

Thinking to alter the prayers of the one who was Mañjuśrī in person, Mipham Rinpoche, just a
little, I, Maṅgala Śrībhūti (Tashi Paljor, Kyabje Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche), wrote this supplication.
May it serve as a cause for the sun of the wisdom lineage to rise and open the
lotus blossom of our hearts!
