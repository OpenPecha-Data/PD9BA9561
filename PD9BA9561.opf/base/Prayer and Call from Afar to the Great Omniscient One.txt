Prayer and Call from Afar to the Great Omniscient One

by Jamyang Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö

Embodiment of all sources of refuge, root guru, care for me!

Magical embodiment of all the buddhas' wisdom,Merely to think of you banishes the anxieties
of existence and peace.Omniscient Drimé Özer, care for me.Look upon me with compassion here
and now.

The three seats are complete in the maṇḍala of your form,The sound and emptiness of your speech
has the sixty qualities of Brahma's voice,And the essence of clear light is profound peace,
free of complexity.Longchen Rabjam, indivisible from the three kāyas,Look upon me without
departing unmanifest space.

As an adornment to the great bliss chakra at my crownAnd in the pavilion of light within the
centre of my heart,May you always remain inseparably,Granting blessings, empowerment and
attainment.

With the brilliant light of your knowledge and love,Eliminate from its very sourceThe darkness
that dwells within my heart.

Cause me to realize directly and without errorThe systems of the outer and inner sciences,Especially
the profound nature of reality itself,Unleash the power of the wisdom of awareness,And
deliver the great treasure of courageous eloquence.

As I exert myself day and night with river-like continuityOn the path of the four visions of
clear light,May objective appearances fade awayIn the expanse of dharmatā, and for the rest
of existenceMay I have the supreme vajra form of the rainbow bodyAnd bring about immeasurable
benefit for others' sake.

Enclosed within clear light, the youthful body in a vase,Inwardly luminous wisdom is indwelling
yet not dullAnd outwardly radiant wisdom presents an infinite arrayOf buddha forms, wisdoms
and purelands.May the boundless activity of liberating beingsUnfold permanently, pervasively
and spontaneously.

Throughout this and all my future lives,May you, the omniscient, perfectly awakened one,Remain
as the lord of my buddha family without ever parting,And may you confer the vajra wisdom
upon me.

Care for me! Care for me! O guru, care for me!
