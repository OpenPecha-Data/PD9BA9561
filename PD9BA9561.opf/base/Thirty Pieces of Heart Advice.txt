Thirty Pieces of Heart Advice

by Longchen Rabjam

From his great clouds of prayers arising through wisdom, which permeates the dimension of reality
completely, and through the sunrays of compassion, amṛta falls down unceasingly onto
the field of students, ripening the offshoots of the three kāyas. I bow down at the feet
of the lama, who protects as the embodiment of the Three Jewels.

Though I entered the sacred lineage of accomplishment through the power of my prayers, due to
my lack of effort my life has turned out meaningless and is now vanishing. I had wanted
to act in an honest manner, but now I am in despair and have seen many like me. Out of renunciation
I composed these thirty pieces of heart advice.

Kyeho! Drawing a large following by employing a variety of methodsAlthough we accumulate the
right facilities to establish a monastery,This will become a field of dispute causing attachment.‘To
remain alone’ is my heart advice. Performing village rites, like taming demons
of dead children and the living,Peddling our qualities as merchandise amidst the peopleOut
of attachment to food and wealth, we get carried away by the demons of the mind.‘To tame
one’s own mind’ is my heart advice.By gathering donations from the poor as if imposing taxes,We
can erect large statues and distribute offerings on a vast scale.But even though this
is to support virtuous goals, we instigate others to commit negative actions.‘To keep one’s
mind virtuous’ is my heart advice.Teaching others Dharma out of a desire for greatness
andMaintaining a retinue of important and humble people through skilled methods—A mind involved
with this is the source of pride.‘To have few aspirations’ is my heart advice.Were
we to offer a hundred valuable things accumulated through wrong livelihood,Based on conducting
business, taking interest, deception and so on.We might attempt to be virtuous, but
instead give rise to the eight worldly dharmas.‘To meditate on renunciation’ is my heart advice.Through
taking on responsibility, bearing witness, enforcing the law and so on,We reconcile
people in their disputes, thinking this benefits them,But still, aversion and attachment
arise.‘To be without hope and fear’ is my heart advice.To have subordinates, wealth,
a retinue, good fortune andFame spreading through the whole world –At the time of death
all this is of no benefit.‘To be diligent in one’s practice’ is my heart advice.Even though
caretakers, attendants, people in charge and cooksConstitute the lifeblood of a monastery,Entertaining
dualistic perception is the cause for strife.‘To give up such chores’ is my
heart advice.To carry whatever we think necessary to the cave,Statues, offerings, texts,
cooking utensils and the like,All hastily gathered together, leads to suffering and dispute.‘To
be frugal’ is my heart advice.Pointing out faults to a short-tempered retinueIn these
degenerate times, even with the wish to benefit,Gives rise to negative states of mind.‘To
speak peacefully’ is my heart advice.Giving advice with a wish to benefit and without self-interest,Or
lovingly pointing out someone’s hidden faults,We might be honest, but still
it creates heartache.‘To speak pleasantly’ is my heart advice.When we support our own side
and refute the other,We might think this is the way to propagate the teachings during debate,But
instead it will give rise to negative states of mind.‘To stop talking’ is my heart
advice.Through being partial towards our lama, lineage and practice,We believe we are upholding
them.But to praise our own side whilst disparaging others is the source of attachment
and aversion.‘To give all this up’ is my heart advice.After differentiating and examining
the teachings we have studied,We find faults in the teachings of others and might believe
this to be wisdom.But through this we accrue negative deeds.‘To train in pure view’ is
my heart advice.Speaking about blank emptiness and disregarding cause and effect,Thinking
that non-action is the ultimate,We give up the two kinds of accumulation, leading to the
deterioration of our practice.‘To practice unifying both’ is my heart advice.We let the innermost
essence descend for the sake (of practicing) the third (empowerment),Thinking we enhance
our practice by relying on a consort.Yet many have been deceived by such contaminated
ways.‘To practice the path of liberation’ is my heart advice.To bestow empowerments upon
improper people,And to distribute sacred substances among the ordinaryIs the basis for slander
and the deterioration of samaya.‘To start in the proper way’ is my heart advice.To
be naked and so on in the middle of ordinary people,We might think of such eccentric behaviour
as part of higher asceticism,But it is a reason for worldly beings to lose faith in what
is pure.‘To act with mindfulness’ is my heart advice.Aspiring to be someone superior where
we reside,Even if we act purely and are learned,Is the cause to fall from the highest
point to the lowest.‘To be neither too tight nor too loose’ is my heart advice.In villages,
monasteries, caves and such places—Wherever we might stay—let us not look for close friendship,But
with whomever we become acquainted, be neither too intimate nor too hostile.‘To
remain self-reliant’ is my heart advice.In order to receive provisions from the faithful,We
might pay respect in a hypocritical wayTo attract attention, but that will only fetter
us.‘To act regarding everything as equal’ is my heart advice.There are many texts on craft,
astrology and medicine,All sources for understanding the methods of interdependence,Yet
to know too many things ruins one’s meditation.‘To limit the objects of knowledge’ is my
heart advice. To replicate the arrangements of the home,When venturing into solitudeIs to
waste one’s life in a meaningless manner.‘To give up too many activities’ is my heart advice.There
might be excellent qualities in strivingFor learnedness and purity,But whatever we
are attached to will only bind the mind stream.‘To be without bias’ is my advice from the
heart.Summoning hail and thunderbolts and the like, producing black magic spells and protecting
oneself,We might believe these are activities to subdue those who are hardest to tame,But
this will only inflame their minds and lead us to the lower realms.‘To take a humble
place’ is my heart advice.To amass a multitude of profound textsSuch as scriptures, commentaries
and oral instructions,Without practicing them, will be of no benefit at the time
of death.‘To watch your mind’ is my heart advice.When we accomplish remaining one-pointedly,
we can gain insights and understanding,But to write spiritual texts and songs of realization
about them,Even though they are signs of experience, will give rise to conceptualization.‘To
maintain a non-conceptual frame of mind’ is my heart advice.When conceptual thoughts
arise, the direct view is crucial;Having examined the mind, to settle it is crucial;Even
as there is nothing to meditate on, to meditate is crucial.‘To remain undistracted’ is
my heart advice.Dwelling in the state of emptiness, acting according to (the law of) cause
and effect;Realizing non-action, keeping the three vows;Without focus, exert yourself in
benefitting beings through compassion.‘To engage in the two accumulations indivisibly’ is
my heart advice.If we have listened to many learned masters and received deep instructions,Have
studied a few sūtras and tantras,Without ever applying them—‘Oh how pitiful!’—we are
just fooling ourselves.

For myself and others like me, I have explained these thirty pieces of heart advice. Through
composing this, with a mind of renunciation, may all beings be freed from cyclic existence
and reach the pure realms. May I emulate the conduct of the victors of the three times,
their heirs and the great rishis, so that I may become their foremost heir.

Motivated by a slight sense of renunciation, I, Tsultrim Lodrö, composed these thirty pieces
of heart advice. May all be auspicious!
