Prayer to the Omniscient Longchen Rabjam
adapted by Nyoshul Khen Rinpoche

dzamling dzepé gyen druk chok nyi dang
Just like the Six Ornaments and Two Supreme Ones who beautify our world,
tukjé lungtok nyampé tu nga yang
You were their equal in your mastery of compassion, learning and realization,
naktrö dampar bepé tulshyuk kyi
Yet you practised hidden in the forest in sacred solitude.
khordé chökur dzokpé longchenpa
Longchenpa, who perfected saṃsāra and nirvāṇa in the state of dharmakāya,
drimé özer shyab la solwa deb
Drimé Özer—Stainless Light—at your feet I pray:
semnyi neluk tokpar jingyi lob
Grant your blessing so I may realize the natural state, the true nature of mind!1
